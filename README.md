# animablu
Anima Blu website for Francesco Canale
Created by Amit Baum as part of the stage at Kilobit Torino
---------------------

This website is built with TypeScript on the node.js environment and the React library

To start the localhost page run the terminal command:
npm start

------ Setup VScode workstation on your PC / MacOS:
git config user.email "youremail@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"


------ Install TypeScript globally with the latest stable version:
npm install -g -D typescript

On MacOS use this command instead:
sudo npm install -g -D typescript


The npx command allows you to run the Create React App package without having to install it globally:
npx create-react-app new-app-name


------ Create a React project inside the root folder:
tsc --init

This will generate a tsconfig.json file in your projectâ€™s root folder, allowing you to configure and customize TypeScript compilation options.

Modify the tsconfig.json file for the latest React version:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    // "jsx": "react-jsx", /* For the latest React version, without preserving the jsx code on buildup */
    "jsx": "preserve" /* Use "jsx": "preserve" when you want the JSX code to remain intact for further processing by a build tool or bundler. */
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
